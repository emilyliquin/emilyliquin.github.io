I'm a fifth year PhD student at Princeton University, working in Tania Lombrozo's [Concepts and Cognition Lab](http://cognition.princeton.edu/). I also collaborate with Alison Gopnik and the the [Gopnik Cognitive Development and Learning Lab](http://gopniklab.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley. Before graduate school, I received my BA in Psychology and Cognitive Science from Northwestern University.

I study how children and adults learn about the world by exploring and asking questions. My research asks how and why information search is selective: why do humans feel compelled to explore in some settings but not others? My research is funded by the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).
