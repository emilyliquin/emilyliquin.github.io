Hello! I'm a cognitive scientist studying exploration and learning in humans across the lifespan. I am interested in (1) how and why people seek information and (2) how differences in exploration translate to differences in learning. I answer these questions using experimental, developmental, and computational methods. My aim is to leverage the findings from my research to improve the efficacy of exploration in real-world settings.

I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Psychology at New York University, funded by the [NSF SBE Postdoctoral Research Fellowship](https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2204021). I work with [Dr. Todd Gureckis](http://gureckislab.org/) and [Dr. Marjorie Rhodes](http://kidconcepts.org/).

I started my Ph.D. in Psychology at University of California, Berkeley from 2016-2018, then moved to Princeton University, where I completed my Ph.D. in 2021. I worked with [Dr. Tania Lombrozo](http://cognition.princeton.edu/) and [Dr. Alison Gopnik](http://gopniklab.berkeley.edu/). My graduate research was funded by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program. I received my BA in Psychology and Cognitive Science from Northwestern University.
