Hello! I'm a cognitive scientist studying inquiry and learning in humans across the lifespan. I am interested in (1) how, when, and why people seek information and (2) how differences in inquiry translate to differences in learning. I answer these questions using experimental, developmental, and computational methods. My aim is to leverage the findings from my research to improve the efficacy of inquiry in real-world settings.

<b>Starting Fall 2024, I will be an Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychology at the University of New Hampshire.</b> If you are interested in joining my future lab, please feel free to reach out! You can also find more information on my [lab website](https://liquinlab.github.io).

I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Psychology at New York University, funded by the [NSF SBE Postdoctoral Research Fellowship](https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2204021). I work with [Dr. Todd Gureckis](https://gureckislab.org/) and [Dr. Marjorie Rhodes](https://kidconcepts.org/).

I started my Ph.D. in Psychology at University of California, Berkeley from 2016-2018, then moved to Princeton University, where I completed my Ph.D. in 2021. I worked with [Dr. Tania Lombrozo](https://cognition.princeton.edu/) and [Dr. Alison Gopnik](https://gopniklab.berkeley.edu/). My graduate research was funded by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program. I received my B.A. in Psychology and Cognitive Science from Northwestern University.
